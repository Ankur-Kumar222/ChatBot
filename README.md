# ChatBot
##Overview:
The provided code implements a chatbot using Streamlit, Hugging Face's Transformers library for natural language processing tasks, and Faiss for similarity search. The chatbot interacts with users, understands their queries, fetches relevant contexts, and provides answers to their questions.
##Components:
###1. Models Initialization:
 Two models are initialized:
 RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation): It retrieves relevant contexts given a query.
 QA (Question Answering): It answers questions given a context.
###2. Text Fetching Function (text_fetch()):
 Given a query text, this function uses the RAG model to find similar contexts.
 It encodes the query, computes its embedding, searches for similar embeddings in the Faiss index, and returns the most similar context if it meets a similarity threshold.
###3. Question Answering Function (question_answer()):
 This function utilizes the QA model to answer questions.
 It tokenizes the question and context, generates segment IDs, feeds them to the QA model, and reconstructs the answer from the model's output.
###4. Streamlit Setup:
 Streamlit is configured to create a chat interface.
 Chat messages are displayed with avatars (user or bot).
###5. File Reading and Encoding:
 Text files in a specific folder are read, and their content is stored for later retrieval.
 Each text is encoded using the RAG model to obtain embeddings.
###6. Faiss Indexing:
 The encoded vectors of text contexts are indexed using Faiss for efficient similarity search.
###7. Chat Interaction:
 Users input queries via the chat interface.
 The chatbot responds by fetching relevant contexts and providing answers to the queries.
 Responses are displayed in the chat interface, simulating typing by showing a blinking cursor.
