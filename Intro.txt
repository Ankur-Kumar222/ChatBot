Plaksha's journey started in 2015, as a conversation among a few friends about how and why technology education needs to change. This group of people, most of them entrepreneurs and business leaders, were keen to change the landscape of engineering and technology education in India and the world. Reimagining Higher Education Foundation, a Section 8 not-for-profit company, was set up in 2017 with a mission of converting the idea into a plan. In Feb 2019, the groundbreaking of Plaksha University's campus in Mohali took place with the aim of opening the campus in Aug 2021.
